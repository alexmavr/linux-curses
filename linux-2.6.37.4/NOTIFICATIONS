1. Hello. This is the update notification in case there is something to share. The messages are to be indexed.
2. I have followed http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/courses/cmpe322/fall2009/Tutorials/Kernel%20Compile%20and%20SysCall%20Add%20(Ubuntu%208.04).pdf up to step 8, and I will hopefully finish it tomorrow. If you see this, answer: do I need to patch this tree, or can I just build with gcc 4.4?	::To SELF : system has gcc 4.4, so AOK.
3. Minor fixes in curse_imp files. Need to check if stub syscall works, in order to move to serious action. :: It does.
4. Manual pages for gcc missing. How did thou install it? :: I wanted to find the default gcc library search paths.
5. Changed from mutex bask to semas, because of http://www.dilip.nijagal.com/geeky-stuff/45-technical-stuff/64-difference-between-semaphores-and-mutex
6. FIXME: Find default search paths for includes in sched.h. After, fix inclusion of our library in it (it is "" now). We want our library as part of the kernel.	:: Maybe symlink in include/linux? : symlink is kinda ugly bit it works, need to do some testing, maybe all the headers in include? or the entire implementation?
