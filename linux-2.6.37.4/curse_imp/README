# The curses implementation consists of 3 logical modules.
# FIRST: curse infrastructure implementation
#  Provides support for all the operations described in the initial pdf.
#   TODO: Add more detailed description here.
#   .........................................
# SECOND: curse implementation
#  This refers to the available curses in the system.
# THIRD: curse userspace implementation
#  This is a complete (although overridable) tool, providing the means to use the curse mechanism from userspace.
# 

#
# CURSE ADDITION METHOD:
# The method of adding a new curse in the system, is described below.
# 1. Source code: You have to have the kernel source code for the system call in a source file.
# 2. Curse entry: You have to add an entry to the curse table. An entry consists of a unique name and a descriptive hex value of type uint64_t, like 0xBOOBBOOB.
# 3. Makefile entry: You have to add a new rule for the curse to the existing makefile in the curses subdirectory.
# 4. Recompilation: For the new curse to be added to the system, you have to recompile the curse system.
