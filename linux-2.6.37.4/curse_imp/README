# The curses implementation consists of 3 logical modules.
# FIRST: curse infrastructure implementation
#  Provides support for all the operations described in the initial pdf.
#   TODO: Add more detailed description here.
#   .........................................
# SECOND: curse implementation
#  This refers to the available curses in the system.
# THIRD: curse userspace implementation
#  This is a complete (although overridable) tool, providing the means to use the curse mechanism from userspace.
# 

#
# CURSE ADDITION METHOD:
# The method of adding a new curse in the system is described below.
# 1. Source code: You have to have the kernel source code for the system call in a source file.
# 2. You have to add the function curse_trigger with the id of your curse to the points in the kernel source code where you want to act as trigger points for your curse.
#	2.i.   If a curse_trigger call is not present in a desired point in the kernel source, you have to include the header <curse/curse_externals.h>, and then proceed to step ii.
#   2.ii.  A curse_trigger call needs an argument of type curse_id_t (the curse id type) with the number of the curse to mark as triggered. The argument can consist of an OR mask of multiple curse_id_t values. That means that if a curse_trigger call already exists in a desired point, you just have to OR your curse id with the ones that are there.
#   2.iii. Cases where a single curse has multiple OR a single checkpoint activated during a single process scheduling, the behavior of the curse implementation will be exactly the same.
# 3. Curse entry: You have to add an entry to the curse table. An entry consists of a unique name and a descriptive hex value of type uint64_t, like 0xBOOBBOOB.
# 4. Curse function pointers: You have to include the curse header and the function pointers in the appropriate array in the curse table library.
# 5. Makefile entry: You have to add a new rule for the curse to the existing makefile in the curses directory.
# 6. Recompilation: For the new curse to be added to the system, you have to recompile the kernel.
